		<big><h3 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Origins</h3></big>
		<big><p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Debuting in Mortal Kombat 3, Sektor was a red, cybernetic ninja alongside with Smoke and Cyrax. Before his cyberization, Sektor was the son of the Grandmaster of the Lin Kuei, the clan of the assassins that Sub Zero was apart of. He was extremely devoted to his clan and was the first to accept the Cyber Initiative, the plan to convert all the clan members into cybers. In stark contrast to his immediate counterpart Cyrax, Sektor never bothered to rediscover his human side, and may be unable to.Sometime after he became a cyborg, Sektor ascended to the rank of Grandmaster. However, he was eventually killed and usurped in both timelines by the younger Sub-Zero (Kuai Liang), who then went on to reform the clan altogether.</p></big>

		<big><h3 style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Powers and Abilities</h3></big>
		<big><p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">As a cyber ninja, he possesses enhanced strength and stamina. He is also equipped with weaponry like missiles and flamethrowers. Unlike the other cyborgs, Sektor embraced his new machine body and decided to upgrade it rather than remove it. Due to his upgrades, he possesses a jet propulsion system on each of his joints and new armor plating. He also now has two pulse blades to verse his foes in close quarter combat if needed to. He also possesses the ability to turn invisible.</p></big>
